\begin{abstract}

This paper explores an approach for allowing type classes to be
optionally declared by programmers, i.e. for allowing programmers to
overload symbols without having to declare the types of these symbols
in type classes.

The idea is based on defining the type of un-anottated overloaded
symbol as the anti-unification of instance types defined for the
symbol in a module, by automatically creating a type class with a
single overloaded name. This depends on a modularization of instance
visibility (as well as on a redefintion of Haskell's ambiguity rule).
The paper presents the modifications to Haskell's module system that
are necessary for allowing instances to have a modular scope (based on
previous work published by one of the authors). The definition of the
type of overloaded symbols as the anti-unification of available
instance types and the redefined ambiguity rule is also based on
previous works by the authors. 

The added flexibility to Haskell-style of overloading is illustrated
by defining a type system and a type inference algorithm that allows
overloaded record fields.
