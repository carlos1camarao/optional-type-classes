\section{Modularization of Instances}
\label{sec:modular-instances}

This paper does not attempt to discuss any major revision to Haskell's
module system. Our objective here is simply to allow modular instance
definitions, which enable type classes to be optionally declared by
programmers.

We essentially follow the work of Marco Gontijo and Carlos Camar√£o
\cite{...}, summarized below, but with the following rule for allowing
type classes to be optionally specified.

\begin{definition}[Type of overloaded variables]

If the type of an overloaded variable (i.e.~a variable that is defined
in an instance definition) is not explicitly annotated in a type class
declaration, then the variable's type is the anti-unification of
instance types defined for the variable in the current module;
otherwise, it is the annotated type.
