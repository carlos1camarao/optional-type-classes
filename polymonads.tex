\subsection{Polymonads}
\label{sec:polymonads}

Polymonads \cite{Polymonadic-programming14,Polymonads-in-Haskell2015},
a generalization of monads, give the familiar monadic bind combinator
the more general type:
\[ \texttt{(>>=) :: \mUm\ $a$ $\rightarrow$ ($a$ $\rightarrow$ \mDois\ $b$)
  $\rightarrow$ \mTres\ $b$}
\]
This allows the composition of computations with three different
monads, instead of just one. Consider:

\progb{xx\=xx\=xx\=\kill
  \module\ $P$ (\instance\ \Polymonad\ \mUm\ \mDois\ \mTres) \where\+\\ 
\class\ (\Monad\ \mUm,\Monad\ \mDois) $\!\Rightarrow\!$ \Morph\ $\!$\mUm\ $\!$\mDois\ $\!$\where\+\\
  \morph::$\:$\mUm\ $a$ $\rightarrow$ \mDois\ $a$\-\\ 
\class\ \PolyMonad\ \mUm\ \mDois\ \mTres\ \where\+\\
  (|>>=|)::$\:$\mUm\ $a$ $\rightarrow$ ($a$ $\rightarrow$ \mDois\ $b$) $\rightarrow$ \mTres\ $b$\-\\ 
\instance\  (\Morph\ \mUm\ \mTres,\Morph\ \mDois\ \mTres) $\!\Rightarrow\!$ \PolyMonad\ $\!$\mUm\ $\!$\mDois\ $\!$\mTres\ $\!$\where\+\\
\maa\ |>>=| \fmb\ = \morph\ \maa\ >>= \morph\ $\!$.$\!$ \fmb
}

A module can use the polymonad instance from module $P$ by defining
instances of \Morph\ for type constructors that are instances of \mUm,
\mDois\ and \mTres. It can also import $P$ to export $q$, defined as
follows, which has a constrained type with a type variable, \mTres, that
occurs only in the constraints:

\progb{xx\=xx\=\kill
  \module\ $Q$ ($q$)\+\\
    \import\ $P$ (\instance\ \PolyMonad\ $a$ $b$ $c$)\\
    $q$:: \=(\PolyMonad\ \mUm\ \mDois\ \mTres, \PolyMonad\ \mTres\ \mQuatro\ \mCinco) $\Rightarrow$\+\\
    \mUm\ $a$ $\rightarrow$ ($a$ $\rightarrow$ \mDois\ $b$) $\rightarrow$ ($b$ $\rightarrow$ \mQuatro\ $c$) $\rightarrow$ \mCinco\ $c$\-\\ 
  $q$ $m$ $f$ $g$ = $m$ |>>=| $f$ |>>=| $g$
}

Each use of $q$ in a module $U$ for specific ground instances of
\Monad\ \mUm\ and \Monad\ \mDois, or of specific ground instances of
\Monad\ \mQuatro\ and \Monad\ \mCinco, will require the existence of a
single instance of \Monad\ \mTres. However, this single instance can
be determined since it is the same single instance of
\Morph\ \mDois\ \mTres (in the first case), or the same single
instance of \Morph\ \mTres\ \mQuatro\ (in the second case). Further
investigation is needed, but this seems to avoid the necessity of
using type checker plugins for implementing polymonads, as reported in
\cite{Polymonads-in-Haskell2015}.

Uses of polymonads illustrate that occurrences of variables only in
constraints can occur in practice without implying ambiguity.
Whenever there is a type variable in a constraint that is unreachable
from the set of type variables in the simple type, there must exist
only one instance that entails the constraint where this type variable
occur (in this particular case, only one instance that entails the
type constructor variable).
