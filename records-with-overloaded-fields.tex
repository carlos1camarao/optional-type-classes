\subsection{Records with overloaded fields}
\label{sec:overloaded-record-fields}

In this section we describe how the possibility of overloading symbols
without the need of declaring type classes allows an easy support for
overloaded record fields. Acccessing of an overloaded record field
simply leads to the use of an automatic created instance of an
undeclared type class, and similarly for any update of an overloaded
record field.

We illustrate this idea below by creating an instance of
\get\_\fieldname\ and \update\_\fieldname\ whenever there exists,
respectively, an access of and an update to an overloaded record
field, where \fieldname\ is the name of the overloaded record field.

Consider the following simple example of overloaded record fields:

\progb{\data\ \Address\ \= = \Address\ \= \{ \id\ :: \Int, \aaddress\ \= :: \String\ \= \kill
\data\ \Person\  \> = \Person\  \> \{ \id\ :: \Int, \name\     \> :: \String\ \>\}\\
\data\ \Address\ \> = \Address\ \> \{ \id\ :: \Int, \aaddress\ \> :: \String\ \>\}
}

The overloaded \id\ fields of types \Person\ and \Address\ have types:

\progb{\id\ :: \Address\ \= \kill
\id\ :: \Person\  \>$\rightarrow$ \Int\\
\id\ :: \Address\ \>$\rightarrow$ \Int
}

The following instance declarations without declared type classes can
be automatically created: 

\progb{
\get\_\id\ :: \Person\ $\rightarrow$ \Int\\
\instance\ \get\_\id\ (\Person\ \id\ \_\ )  = \id\\ \\
\get\_\id\ :: \Address\ $\rightarrow$ \Int\\
\instance\ \get\_\id\ (\Address\ \id\ \_\ ) = \id
}

If record field updating is used, updating functions are created, as
illustrated below. Consider for example that record field updating is
used as follows:

\progb{
\update\_\id\ :: \Person\ $\rightarrow$ \Int\ $\rightarrow$ \Person\\
\instance\ \update\_\id\ (\Person\ \id\ \name) \new\_\id\ = \Person\ \new\_\id\ \name\\ \\
\update\_\id\ :: \Address\ $\rightarrow$ \Int\ $\rightarrow$ \Address\\
\instance\ \update\_\id\ (\Address\ \id\ \aaddress) \new\_\id\ = \Address\ \new\_\id\ \aaddress
}

Given any expression $p$ of type \Person, any use of {\tt ($p$
  \{\id\ = \new\_\id\})} could then be translated to {\tt
  (\update\_\id\ $p$ \new\_\id)}.  Similarly, given any expression $a$
of type \Address, any use of {\tt $a\!$ \{\id\ = \new\_\id\}} could
then be translated to {\tt \update\_\id\ $a$ \new\_\id}.
