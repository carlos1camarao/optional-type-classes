\section{Records with overloaded fields}
\label{sec:overloaded-record-fields}

In this section we describe how the possibility of overloading symbols
without the need of declaring type classes allows record fields to be
overloaded, in an easy way.

Consider a simple example of overloaded record fields (taken from
\cite{overloaded-record-fields-in-ghc}):

\progb{\data\ \Address\ \= = \Address\ \= \{ \id\ :: \Int, \address\ \= :: \String\ \= \kill
\data\ \Person\  \> = \Person\  \> \{ \id\ :: \Int, \name\    \> :: \String\ \>\}\\
\data\ \Address\ \> = \Address\ \> \{ \id\ :: \Int, \address\ \> :: \String\ \>\}
}

The overloaded \id\ fields of types \Person\ and \Address\ have the
following types:

\progb{\id\ :: \= \kill
\id\ :: \Person\  \>$\rightarrow$ \Int\\
\id\ :: \Address\ \>$\rightarrow$ \Int
}

In our approach, we would have the following (automatically created
instance declarations without declared type classes), with a special
mark to indicate (not shown below) that the instances are of record
field names, not variable names:

\progb{
\instance\ \get\_\id\ ($p$ :: \Person\ \id\ \_)  = \id\\
\instance\ \get\_\id\ ($a$ :: \Address\ \id\ \_) = \id}

\ldots \ldots
