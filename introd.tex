\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The versions of Haskell supported by GHC \cite{GHC} --- the prevailing
Haskell compiler --- are becoming complex, to the point of affecting
the view of Haskell as the best choice for general-purpose software
development. A basic issue in this regard is the need of extending the
language to allow multiple parameter type classes (MPTCs). This
extension is thought to require additional mechanisms, such as
functional dependencies or type families. In another paper
\cite{JBCS-Ambiguity-and-constrained-polymorphism}, we have shown that
the introduction of MPTCs in the language can and should be done
without the need of additional mechanisms: a simplifying change is
sufficient, to Haskell's ambiguity rule. Interested readers are
referred to \cite{JBCS-Ambiguity-and-constrained-polymorphism}. The
main ideas are summarized below.

Haskell with MPTCs uses constrained types of the form $\forall
\overline{a}.\,C \Rightarrow \tau$, where $C$ is a set of constraints
and $\tau$ is the well-known simple (unconstrained, unquantified)
type; a constraint is a class name followed by a sequence of type
variables.

In (GHC) Haskell, ambiguity is a property of a type: a type $\forall
\overline{a}.\,C \Rightarrow \tau$ is ambiguous if there exists a type
variable that occurs in the constraints ($C$) that is not uniquely
determined from the set of type variables that occur in the simple
type ($\tau$). This unique determination specifies that, for each type
variable $a$ that occurs in $C$ but not in $\tau$ there must exist a
functional dependency $b \mapsto c$ for some $b$ in $\tau$ (or a
similar unique determination specified via type families). Notation $b
\mapsto c$ is used, instead of $b \rightarrow c$, to avoid confusion
with the notation used to denote functional types.

A new definition, which we prefer to call here {\em expression
  ambiguity\/} (in \cite{JBCS-Ambiguity-and-constrained-polymorphism}
it is called {\em delayed closure ambiguity\/}), uses a similar
property, of variable reachability, that is independent of functional
dependencies and type families: a type variable $a$ that occurs in a
set of constraints is reachable from the set of type variables in
$\tau$ if it occurs in $\tau$ or there exists a type variable $b$ in
$C$ that is reachable. For example, in $C \Rightarrow b$, where
$C=(D\: a\: b, E a)$, type variable $a$ is reachable from the set of
type variables in $b$.

The presence of unreachable variables in a constraint $pi\in C$
characterizes overloading resolution, or, in other words, that
overloading is resolved for $\pi$: it characterizes that there is no
context in which an expression with such a type could be placed that
could instantiate such unreachable variables.

The presence of unreachable variables does not necessarily imply
ambiguity. Ambiguity is a property of an expression, and it depends on
the context in which the expression occurs, and on entailment (or
satisfiability) of constraints.

Entailment of constraints and its algorithmic (functional) counterpart
are well-known in the Haskell world (see
e.g.~\cite{MarkJones94a,TheoryOfOverloading,JBCS-Ambiguity-and-constrained-polymorphism}).

Informally, a set of constraints $C$ is entailed (or satisfied) in a
program $P$ if there exists a substitution $\phi$ such that $\phi(C)$
is contained in the set of instance declarations of $P$, or is implied
by the transitivity implied by the set of class and instance
declarations occuring in $P$. For a formal definition, see
e.g.~\cite{MarkJones94a,JBCS-Ambiguity-and-constrained-polymorphism}. In
this case we say that $C$ is entailed by $\phi(C)$. 

For example, {\tt \Eq\ [[\Integer]]} is entailed if we have instances
{\tt \Eq\ \Integer} and {\tt \Eq\ $a$ => \Eq\ [$a$]}, visible in the
context where an expression whose type has a constraint {\tt Eq
  [[Integer]]} occurs.

If overloading is resolved for a constraint $C$ occurring in a type
$\sigma = C,D \Rightarrow \tau$ then exactly one of the following
holds:
\begin{itemize}

\item $C$ is entailed by a single instance; in this case a type
  simplification (also called ``improvement'') occurs: $\sigma$ can be
  simplified to $D \Rightarrow \tau$;

\item $C$ is entailed by more than instance; in this case we have a
  type error: ambiguity; 

\item $C$ is not entailed (by any instance); in this case we have also
  a type error: unsatisfiability.

\end{itemize}

Note that variables in a single constraint are either all reachable or
all unreachable. If they are unreachable, either the constraint can be
removed, in the case of single entailment, or there is a type error
(either ambiguity, in the case of two or more entailments, or
unsatisfiability, in the case of no entaiment).

Instead of being dependent on the specification or not of functional
dependencies or type families, ambiguity depends on the existence of
(two or more) instances in a program context when overloading is
resolved for a constraint on the type of an expression.

The possibility of a modular control of the visibility of instance
definitions conforms to this simplifying change. This is the subject
of Section \ref{sec:modular-instances}.

Also in conformance with this change is the possibility, explored in
this paper, of allowing type classes to be optionally declared by
programmers, i.e. for allowing programmers to overload symbols without
having to declare the types of these symbols in type classes. A type
system and a type inference algorithm for a core-Haskell language
where type classes can be optionally declared is presented in Section
\ref{Optional-type-classes}.  The idea is based on defining the type
of unanottated overloaded symbol as the anti-unification of instance
types defined for the symbol in a module, by automatically creating a
type class with a single overloaded name. This depends on a
modularization of instance visibility (as well as on a redefintion of
Haskell's ambiguity rule).  The paper presents the modifications to
Haskell's module system that are necessary to allow instances to have
a modular scope (based on previous work published by one of the
authors). The definition of the type of overloaded symbols as the
anti-unification of available instance types and the redefined
ambiguity rule is also based on previous works by the authors.

The added flexibility to Haskell-style of overloading is illustrated
by defining a type system and a type inference algorithm that allows
overloaded record fields (Section \ref{sec:overloaded-record-fields}).

% The redefinition of Haskell's ambiguity rule can also be used to
% address some of the issues related to type directed name resolution
% (Section \ref{sec:type-directed-name-resolution}).
