\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has presented an approach for allowing programmers to
overload symbols without declaring their types in type classes. In
this approach, the type of an overloaded symbol is automatically
determined from the anti-unification of instance types defined for the
symbol in the relevant module.

The paper explores this approach in the presence of instance
modularization and an ambiguity rule that is defined differently than
in Haskell.

The approach allows, for example, overloaded record fields and type
directed name resolution to be supported in a simple way.
